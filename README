Welcome to the Pangaia Project, making Web.âˆž.

We're here quietly developing the world's next great economic and information revolution...

* Utilizing the power and wisdom of the crowd (given the right tools and incentives),
* using a stellar theoretical 3d model for organizing the elements of knowledge (which we claim is provably optimal), we are
* creating a distributed peer-to-peer platform for trading creative value (a new_economic_system),
* while allocating decision-making authority fairly and efficiently (a new form of self-organizing governance)
* in a way that inspires even greater participation (a la Reed's Law).

...ultimately to create a beautiful world. We got the cod3z!
