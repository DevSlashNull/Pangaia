Hi.  This is a software project so awesome you're not ready for it.  Read(y) or not.

I'm posting here anyway for those trepid few who wander in, pulled by the lines of subtle gossamer and agglutinizing forces which will bring this project to some invisible completion.

You want a better world, you don't know how to do it.  You feel powerless.  
Pangaia will help.

You think the Internet has more potential, but you think surely the arena is tapped out by now.
Pangaia knows better than you in that case.

You're in a shitload of ennui and anguish, and you're looking for that particular hole in spacetime that will drop you into outside your comfort zone and make you radically productive.
Pangaia's t/here.

Fuck, you can't understand what this is all about.  Well get out now, a project with this much angular momenta will probably send you into an OOB and blow your circuits.
But maybe you're the One.

Yes, it's called the Glass Bead Game, not Pangaia, but bugger off.  We get inconsistent.

....Neo 1 and 8.
