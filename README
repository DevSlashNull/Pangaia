Hello!  This is a software project called PanGaia.  It aims to create an
optimized flow network to create a planetary-wide nervous system -- Web 3D!  

It's aim is high: a maximally collaborative, minimally superfluous, 
visual peer-to-peer system for sharing information and creative expressions 
making a unitied, self-organizing, fractal economy of information and 
knowledge, giving fair credit to each contributor, solving once and for all
the problem of compensation and piracy without stifling innovation.

Your ideas and contributions are encouraged and most welcome!  
Thanks for your interest.  

Please check the wiki for documentation.
