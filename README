Welcome to the Pangaia Project, scaling the World Game and making Web.âˆž.

We're here quietly developing the world's next great economic and information revolution...

* Utilizing the power and wisdom of the crowd (given the right tools and incentives),
* using a stellar theoretical 3d model for organizing the elements of knowledge (which we claim is provably optimal), we are
* creating a distributed peer-to-peer platform for trading creative value (a new economic system),
* while allocating decision-making authority fairly and efficiently (a new form of self-organizing governance)
* in a way that inspires even greater participation (a la Reed's Law).

...ultimately to create a beautiful world. We got the cod3z!  If you're looking to start now, get the paper version from wiki.hackerspaces.org/PangaiaWorldGame

Check the wiki, or if you're looking for the GlassBeadGame go to sourceforge.net,

...so transparent as to be invisible
