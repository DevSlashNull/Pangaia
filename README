Hello!  This is a software project called PanGaia.  It aims to create an
optimized flow network to create a planetary-wide nervous system -- Web 3D!  

It's aim is high: a maximally collaborative, minimally superfluous, 
visual peer-to-peer system for sharing information and creative expressions 
to foster a beautiful, self-organizing, fractal economy of information and 
knowledge.  Your ideas and contributions are encouraged and most welcome!  
Thanks for your interest.  

Please check the wiki for documentation.
