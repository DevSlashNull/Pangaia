Hello!  This is a software project called PanGaia: An answer to 
PIPA/SOPA and other economic woes of the Creative Class. Currently
in pre-alpha and awaiting more code, but a simple demo of what a 
content-centric internet can look like is available. See the wiki 
for spec and throw out the outdated geo- and server-centric web.  

It's aim is high: a maximally collaborative (P2P), minimally 
superfluous, 3-dimensional *content-centric* web for sharing 
knowledge and creativity to form a unified, self-organizing, fractal 
economy of information and knowledge, giving fair credit to each 
contributor, solving once and for all the problem of compensation and 
piracy without stifling innovation.  It will be AWESOME!

The basic demo(.py) is easy to zoom around in and get a sense of 
the 3-d environment.  VPython is free and can be located at 
http://vpython.org.

Your ideas and contributions are encouraged and most welcome!  
Thanks for your interest.  

Please check the wiki for documentation.
