Hello!  This is a software project called PanGaia.  It will create a P2P
optimized flow network and generate a *content-centric* web to supplant 
the outdated geo- and server-centric web.  

It's aim is high: a maximally collaborative, minimally superfluous, 
3-dimesional system for sharing knowledge and creativity  to make a 
unified, self-organizing, fractal economy of information and knowledge, 
giving fair credit to each contributor, solving once and for all
the problem of compensation and piracy without stifling innovation.

Your ideas and contributions are encouraged and most welcome!  
Thanks for your interest.  

Please check the wiki for documentation.
