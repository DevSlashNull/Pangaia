Hello!  This is a software project called Social-Garden.  It aims to create an
optimized flow network to create a planetary-wide nervous system.  It's aim 
is high: a maximally collaborative, minimally superfluous, peer-to-peer system 
of sharing information and creative expressions to foster a beautiful, self-
organizing, fractal economy of information and knowledge.  Your ideas and 
contributions are encouraged and most welcome!  Thanks for your interest.
