Hello!  This is a software project called PanGaia: An answer to 
PIPA/SOPA and other economic woes of the Creative Class. Currently
in pre-alpha and awaiting more code, but a simple demo of what a 
content-centric internet can look like is available. See the wiki 
for spec and throw out the outdated geo- and server-centric web.  

It's aim is high: a maximally collaborative (P2P), minimally 
superfluous, 3-dimensional *content-centric* web for sharing and 
organizing to create a unified, fractal economy of information and 
knowledge, giving fair credit to each contributor, solving once and 
for all the problem of compensation and piracy without stifling 
innovation.  It will be AWESOME!

The basic demo(.py) is easy to zoom around in and get a sense of 
the 3-d environment.  See the INSTALL file to get it up and 
running!  

Your ideas and contributions are encouraged and most welcome!  
Thanks for your interest.  

Please check the wiki for documentation.
