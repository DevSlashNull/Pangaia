Hi.  This is a software project so awesome you're not ready for it.  Read(y) or not.

I'm posting here anyway for those trepid few who wander in, 
pulled by a subtle agglutinizing force that will bring the depth of 
this project to some invisible completion.

You want a better world, you don't know how to do it.  You feel powerless.  
Pangaia will help.

You think the Internet has more potential, but you think surely the arena is tapped out by now.
Pangaia knows better than you in that case.

You're in a shitload of anguish and ennui, and you're looking for that particular hole in 
spacetime that will drop you into outside your comfort zone.
Pangaia's there.

Fuck, you can't understand what this is all about.  Well get out now, a project with this 
much angular momenta will probably send your circuits out of control.

Yes, it's called the Glass Bead Game, but bugger off.  We get inconsistent.

I said "we", but I'm the only One.  For now...

....Neo 1 and 8.
