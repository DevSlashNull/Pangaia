To run the (very) basic demo:

Get VPython (free) at http://vpython.org.  The pangaia code uses python v2.7 so don't get the version for PythonV3.

Start VIDLE (included in the vpython) and open the demo.py file.

Then Run.  VPyhton has builtin rotate and zoom.

Left-click affects radius, but that's all right now.

See source file for TODO list.

Send feedback to dreamingforward@gmail.com.  Thanks!!
