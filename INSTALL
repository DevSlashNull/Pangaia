To run the (very) basic demo:

Get VPython (free) at http://vpython.org.  The pangaia project uses 
python v2.7 so don't get the version for PythonV3.

Start VIDLE (included in the vpython) and then open the demo.py file 
located in Social-Garden's python directory.

Then Run -> Run Module.  You can zoom (Alt-Left mouse) and rotate 
(right-mouse).  Try it to get the full effect.  Left-click affects 
radius on existing node otherwise creates a new light source.

*****

Believe it or not, although there's only half-dozen files and the 
project is non-functional, it's still nearly 90% there to a working 
prototype.  Need only to set the relationships from the flow network 
to their visual representations, and get the mouse events programmed 
in.  See the source file(s) for TODO list(s).

And see the Pangaia Paper at <http://ow.ly/9KJVn> for how it all 
fits it in a grand scheme to create a beautiful world.
