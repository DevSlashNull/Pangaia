To run the (very) basic demo:

Get VPython (free) at http://vpython.org.  The pangaia project uses 
python v2.7 so don't get the version for PythonV3.

Start VIDLE (included in the vpython) within the social-garden directory
and then open the demo.py file located there.

Then Run -> Run Module.  You can zoom (Alt-Left mouse) and rotate 
(right-mouse).  Try it to get the full effect.  Left-click affects 
radius on existing node otherwise creates a new light source.
