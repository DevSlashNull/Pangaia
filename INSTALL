To run the (very) basic demo:

Get VPython (free) at http://vpython.org.  
The pangaia code uses python v2.7 so don't get the version for PythonV3.

Start VIDLE (included in the vpython) and open the demo.py file located
in Social-Garden's python directory.

Then Run.  VPython has builtin rotate and zoom.

Left-click affects radius on existing node otherwise creates 
a new light source.

*****

Believe it or not, although there's only half-dozen files and the project 
non-functional, it's still nearly 90% there to a working prototype.
Need only to set the relationships from the flow network to their visual 
representations, and get the (few) events programmed in.

See source file for more TODO list.
