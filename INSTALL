To run the (very) basic demo:

Get VPython (free) at http://vpython.org.  The pangaia code is using python v2.7.

Start VIDLE (included in the vpython) and open the demo.py file.

Then Run.   Rotate is with right-mouse drag, and zoom with both buttons (or Option/Alt+Left-click/drag).  Left-click affects radius, but this is all very crude right now.

TODO:

* Add ability to add a label to a node.  Ideally only visible on mouse-over.
* Add ability to link nodes, use a gravity/time-step to animate the nodes closer together.
* Add ability to select a set of nodes and *group* them.
