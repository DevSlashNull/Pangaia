To run the (very) basic demo:

Get VPython (free) at http://vpython.org.  The pangaia code uses python v2.7 so don't get the version for PythonV3.

Start VIDLE (included in the vpython) and open pangaia's demo.py file.

Then Run.  VPython has builtin rotate and zoom.

Left-click affects radius on existing node otherwise creates a new light source.

See source file for TODO list.

Send feedback to dreamingforward@gmail.com.  Thanks!!
