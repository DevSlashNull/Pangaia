To run the (very) basic demo:

Get VPython (free) at http://vpython.org.  The pangaia project uses 
python v2.7 so don't get the version for PythonV3.  Python is already
included with VPython.

Enter the SocietyOfMind directory and start VIDLE.  In VIDLE, select File
and Open the file demo.py located in the SocietyOfMind directory.

You should see the source code of demo.py.  Hit F5 or Run -> Run Module.  
A screen of random nodes should show up on the screen.  Click on a dark area
to add a light source which should light up the scene more.  Zoom (Alt-Left mouse) 
and rotate (right-mouse) around to get the full effect.

Various parameters at the top of the source code can be changed to play
around.
